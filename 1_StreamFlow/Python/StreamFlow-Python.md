### Analytical workflow

* Restate the question, if necessary
* What data do I need to answer the question? 
* Do these data exist?
  * Yes -> Obtain the data
  * No -> Do any useful proxies or models exist?
* Explore the data
* Clean the data
* Analyze the data
* Did it answer the question? 
  * Yes -> Communicate results
  * No -> Revise the question/data needs

### I. Restate the question if necessary

Often, research questions are first posed in ways that require clarification and/or interpretation. For example, a client asked: "How has Falls Lake reservoir affected streamflow?" This question includes some nice specifics: we know where we are going to work (downstream Falls Lake), and what we are going to measure (stream flow). However, it fails to define what constitutes "affected". As a data analyst, your first job would be to clarify this question into one that has a definitive answer, or at least on in which we can present data to a decision maker so that he or she can make an informed decision. 

This step usually requires some communication between the the client, project managers, experts in the field, and you, the data analyst. (And let's hope it goes better than this meeting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg .) For our example, however, we'll narrow the question down to the following objectives...

* Purely visual examination of the data
  * To allow a purely visual examination of the impact of Falls Lake, plot daily streamflow (mgd) for the entire period of record (1930 to present) for the Neuse River near Clayton USGS site (gage# 02087500). 
  * Present the confidence of these data in terms the relative proportion of gage records classified as "approved for publication" (`A`), "provisional, subject to revision" (`P`), and "estimated" (`e`). 
  * Compute monthly variation in stream flow: 
    * For the entire period of record
    * For data prior to Falls Lake construction (before 1980)
    * After Falls Lake completion (after 1984)
* ​



### II. What data do I need to answer the question?
